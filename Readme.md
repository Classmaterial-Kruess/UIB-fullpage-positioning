# FUIB-Fullpage-Position

Let's take advantage of positioning and Flexbox to recreate the reference image below -

![The overview](./images/desktop.png "The general overview")

## Keep in Mind

- The hero section at the top of the page should use the `header.jpg` image supplied in the `images` folder.
- Use semantic tags i.e. `<header>`, `<nav>` etc.
- The **HOME** button is always in the same position, as shown in the online version.
- `::before` and `::after` pseudo elements should be used to create the four dots in the main section ;)
- For the three cards at the bottom change their `z-index` on `:hover`

## Tasks
**try to rebuild the page like the example image**

1. Create the image at the to as near as you can to the original image
2. postion the text at the middel of the image
3. create the navigationbar the links sould have a hover effect
4. Think about a way to find a way for the position of the middel line and the colored dots.

## Bonus

1. The Navbar should always stay at the to if you are scrolling down
2. Try to use a hover effect for the colored cards at the bottom. If you hover about one of the cards, the card should be in front to read the whole text.

Good luck and have fun!
