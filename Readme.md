# FUIB-Fullpage-Position

The task is to recreate the reference image. Try to recreate the website as best you can using what you have learned so far and through your own research. You are also welcome to ask your teachers ;)-

## Indeas and Tipps

- Avoid information like 100vw 100svw 100lvw!!!
- Use sematic elements where possible.
- Use the position property only where necessary!
- Build auxiliary containers to make it easier to align elements
- There is more than one way to recreate the website, so there is no right solution!

## Tasks
**try to rebuild the page like the example image**

1. Try to align the top image as accurately as possible, as in the preview image, and position the lettering in the middle
2. The navigation bar should always be visible at the top of the page when scrolling.
3. Think about a structure for the next section.
    - Create the 4 cards and the optical dividing line with the 4 colored dots
    - Please note that there are different ways to implement this (the pseudo-elements ::before and ::after can be useful, but not a must!)
4. The bottom colored cards should have a hover effect, which ensures that the card is completely visible and readable.

## Bonus

To jump to a specific point on a website by clicking on an element, you use a so-called bookmark jump. (Back to Top Button)

1. Give the button in the footer a bookmark jump to jump back to the top of the page.
2. Add another bookmark jump to the About button in the navbar to jump to the main part (the 4 cards with the 4 dots)
3. Insert another bookmark jump in the home button to also jump back to the beginning of the page

Good luck and have fun!
